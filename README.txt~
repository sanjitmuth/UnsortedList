1. In order to compile the code, simply type make into the terminal.
2. To run the code, type ./UnsortedListDriver
3. Then select which type of list you want to run (1 - int, 2 - Student)

(I am aware the make file should compile AND run the code, but it is not running it for some reason. My apologies)
